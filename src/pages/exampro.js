        <h1>ExamPro.co</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Exampro.co is an e-learning company that provides fast and easy cloud training. I was assigned to improve their <b>UX process</b> that is related to <b>UX research (Empathize)</b> and had to <b>improve the current user flows</b> which required me to obtain relevant feedback and suggestions from customers. 
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>There was a <b>disconnect of information</b> between the <b>customers and the team</b> (developers, design and stakeholders). The team needed to better <b>understand the user</b> so that they can improve their experience before the user reaches support with frustration. Surveys and customer support are always a time consuming process for the customer. We require a <b>quick and easy</b> way for the users to <b>express themselves</b> so that we can <b>improve the UX process.</b></p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>

        <p>The <b>customers are also stakeholders</b> so I obtained my research by creating a <a href='https://discord.gg/rTkejj4' target="blank">discord community</a> for the users where they could <b>publicly express and collaborate</b> with other cloud learners, developers and <b>ExamPro team</b>. The users expressed directly about any issues or opinions and got into discussion with the ExamPro team. The users would also solve other userâ€™s issues if they had faced it themselves. </p>
        
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Identified & reported over <b>250+ Ux issues/bugs</b> on Github with the help of the ExamPro community on discord and HotJar behaviour analytics. </li>

        <h1>1. Empathizing The User</h1>
        <p>After several interviews with some <b>personas</b> such as <b>students and professionals</b> we found that when it comes to learning, users remember the knowledge by <b>testing themselves by learning in groups, study partners and with experts</b>. This gives them confidence along with <b>long term knowledge</b> and a boost to complete their studies.</p>

        <h1>Empathize (Learning Outcomes)</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Users require to <b>test themselves</b> with groups, study partners and experts to enhance their <b>long term knowledge</b></li>
          <li>Information is <b>retained better</b> when <b>studying in groups</b> than studying alone</li>
          <li>Users need to identify their <b>information gaps</b> by discussing with other learners or experts</li>
          
        </ul>

        <h1>2. Defining Standpoint</h1>
        <p>The standpoint is that we need to bridge the ExamPro team and the users <b>with a community.</b> The persona's goal is to learn and gain knowledge. But achieve that <b>long term knowledge</b> we require the <b>users to have a stake</b> in discussion, contribution, learning and be able to test themselves with experts (ExamPro Team), other cloud learners and study groups. We understand that we need to <b>build and maintain a community of learners</b> to enhance users for that <b>long term knowledge.</b> </p>

        <figure className='white-bg'>
        <h1>3. Ideate</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Users need a community to build the <b>long term knowledge</b> </li>
          <li>Users must be able <b>test themselves to identify information gaps</b> with experts, study groups and ExamPro team </li>
          <li>Users must feel <b>they belong to the product</b> they are using and confess to the ExamPro team for any improvements</li>

        <h1>Ideating Relevant Functionality</h1>
        <p>Based on Maslow's Theory Of Hierarchy Need we organize user's need through each phase </p>

        <h1>4. Prototype</h1>
        <p>In this stage i improved several UI's that were reported by the users on discord community while they were on their study journey. I then procedded to make fixes of certain UI using Adobe XD</p>

        </figure>
   
        <figure className="white-bg">
        <h1>5. Testing</h1>
        <p>We used <a href='https://www.hotjar.com/' target="blank">HotJar behaviour analytics</a> to test the UI improvements to understand how users behave on your site</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HotJar analytics enables us to see how the user found problems that were reported on discord</li>
          <li>Identified UI issues for different devices that were related to CSS breakpoints for several pages</li>
          <li>Resolved registration issues on mobile vs web</li>
          <li>Identified several 500 and 404 error</li>
          <li>Reported certain flows where users bounced off too much on page</li>
        </ul>
